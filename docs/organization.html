<p>Meade Telescope Serial Command Protocol
Revision L
9 October 2002
Introduction
The Meade Telescope Serial Control Protocol utilized to 
remotely command and control Meade Telescopes. This command language contains a 
core of common commands supported by all telescopess. Due to different 
implementation and technological advances the command has extensions that are not 
supported by all models. The differences are noted in the descriptive text for 
the commands. Finally, there are a series of new commands for the 
LX200GPS. These commands are in the LXGPS module.</p>
<p>As an extension to the Telescope Protocol beginning with the LX200GPS, a 
possible response to any command is ASCII NAK (0x15). Should the telescope 
control chain be busy and unable to accept an process the command, a NAK will 
be sent within 10 msec of the receipt of the # terminating the command. In this 
event, the controller should wait a reasonable interval and retry the command.</p>

Notes:
Commands accepted by the telescopes are shown in the table above indicated by an x entry. This means that
the telescope will accept these commands and respond with a syntactically valid response where required.
A "p" indicated only a subset of this command class is supported. Due to the differing implementations of
the telescopes, some of the commands may provide static responses or may do nothing in response to the
command. See the detailed description of the commands to determine the exact behavior.</p>
<p>Command line example:</p>
<p>from LX200 import *
port = LXSerial(debug=True)
port.connect("COM1")
scope = Telescope(port, "LX200", debug=True) #
scope.set_site(1)
scope.set_align_mode("P")
scope.set_slew_rate(<code>FIND</code>)
if scope.determine_model=="LX200GPS": #optional
    scope.model = <code>LX200GPS</code>
    scope.auto_align()
else:
    raw_input("do your alignment, then press enter ")</p>
<p>scope.set_pointing_mode(<code>HIGH PRECISION</code>)
library = Library(port, scope)
library.set_M_object(101)
#fine adjust
raw_input("center the object, then press enter ")</p>
<p>library.sync_object()
# etc...
comPort.close()</p>
<p>or, just run
>python LX200.py  do basic setup in main()</p>
<p>This code is not safe for multi-threaded serial port operation...
The author(s) bear no responsibility for equipment, financial, or psychological 
damages due to use of this code.</p>
<p>From an email exchage:
My rule of thumb for choosing between an attribute and a method is
that attribute access should not create new objects.</p>
<p>Interesting rule...    In NumPy this is not quite the rule followed.  
Bascially attributes are used when getting or setting intrinsinc 
"properties" of the array.  Attributes are used for properties that are 
important in defining what an array <em>is</em>.   The flags attribute, for 
example, is an important intrinsinc property of the array but it returns 
an flags object when it is accessed.   The flat attribute also returns a 
new object (it is arguable whether it should have been a method or an 
attribute but it is enough of an intrinsic property --- setting the flat 
attribute sets elements of the array -- that with historical precedence 
it was left as an attribute). </p>
